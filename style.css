    <h1> Austin's Droupout  Story </h1>

    <p> I remember celebrating with my friends that I got the Gilman scholar award. They told me they weren't surprised, but I sure was!
      Even though I of course had to deny it once the entire world came to a crawl, it made me tear up thinking about how people saw my potential.
      Thus I also applied to engineering conferences and other scholarships. 
      <br>   <br>
      <p>Lo and behold, it worked!</p>
      <br>   <br>

      
      <p>While attending these conferences and somehow getting interviews with huge chemical companies, I felt the same sense of wonder as when I 
        first got accepted into this program. The things I'll do, learn, experience... and how happy I'll be. 

        <br>   <br>
        <p>
          Unfortunately once again due to the global situation the positions were even harder to get than usual. Being in Houston, the only
          options left were petroleum companies. At this point I also got a promotion at work which meant I could both move around freely and still
          make a decent amount of money. My heart nor mind were ready to sign up for more classes, so I just didn't. 
        </p>

        
        <br>   <br>
        <p>
          I'm not sure how many people take gap years in the middle of their degree, nor do I know if I'll return to school this year or next. What I 
          do know is that I'll change my degree to software engineering and become a consultant. Free to roam around, exploring and experiencing the world, 
          living my best life. 
        </p>
